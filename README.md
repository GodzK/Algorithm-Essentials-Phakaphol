# ðŸ“˜ Algorithm-Essentials: Bridging Theory and Real-World Practice

This repository provides a comprehensive collection of essential algorithms implemented in **JavaScript**, designed to bridge the gap between theoretical foundations and practical applications. Based on the book *Algorithm Essentials: Bridging Theory and Real-World Practice*, this project aims to support learners, developers, and interview candidates by offering:

- ðŸ“š Clear and concise algorithm explanations  
- ðŸ’» JavaScript implementations with comments and modular structure  
- ðŸ§  Real-world examples and problem-solving strategies  
- ðŸ§ª Test cases and performance considerations

## ðŸ§© Topics Covered
- Sorting & Searching (e.g., Merge Sort, Binary Search)
- Recursion & Backtracking
- Dynamic Programming
- Graph Algorithms (DFS, BFS, Dijkstraâ€™s, etc.)
- Greedy Techniques
- Divide and Conquer
- Time & Space Complexity Analysis

## ðŸ‘¥ Who This Is For
Ideal for:
- Computer Science students
- Coding interview prep
- Developers looking to strengthen algorithmic thinking
